# Screen-Glitcher
A small python program that creates a full-screen glitch effect.

I wrote this like 6 years ago during covid, was tested with X11 on a linux system.
May have compatability issue with newer python packages or versions, as well as windows/mac/linux(with wayland) systems.


### Usage
1. Create a venv in {project_root}/"venv"
2. Enter the venv with ./venv/bin/activate
3. run pip install -r "requirements.txt"
4. Exit the venv and run start.sh or start.bat depending on your system.
